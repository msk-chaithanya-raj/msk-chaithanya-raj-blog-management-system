# Blog Management System with Express.js

## 1. Create a New Project Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigate into it. This is where all the files for your Blog Management System will be stored.

## 2. Initialize the Project

Run `npm init -y` to initialize the project. This will generate the `package.json` file, which contains the metadata and dependencies for your Node.js application.

## 3. Install Required Dependencies

Install essential packages such as Express, Mongoose (for MongoDB), JWT (for token management), and other utilities like Bcrypt (for hashing passwords) and Nodemailer (for email functionality). For development, install `nodemon` to automatically restart the server during development.

## 4. Project Structure

Organize your files into different folders to manage Models, Routes, and Controllers:

- **Models:** Defines the database structure.
- **Routes:** Defines the API routes.
- **Controllers:** Contains the business logic for each route.
- **Server:** Main file to start the server.

## 5. Write the Code

### 5.1. Create Models (Mongoose Schemas)

- Define Mongoose schemas for `User`, `Blog`, and `Comment` to structure the data in MongoDB.

### 5.2. Write Controllers

- Create functions for user registration and login, including password encryption and JWT token generation. Handle errors appropriately.

### 5.3. Write Routes

- Define API routes for user-related actions (like register and login) in the routes folder.

### 5.4. Configure the Server

- Set up the Express server and MongoDB connection. Include the necessary middlewares for parsing JSON and environment variable handling.

## 6. Add Environment Variables

Set up a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as database credentials and JWT secrets.

## 7. Start the Server

Use `nodemon` to run the server locally and start testing the API using Postman.
